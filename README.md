Copilot.

This is a learning experiment in which I'm attempting to learn Rust with AI. I
want to learn Rust, and I also want to get a feeling for how much AI can help in
the process of learning a new programming language.

One major issue with this approach is that it can generate code that doesn’t
follow best practices or is not optmized for performance. For a developer not
familiar with the target language, this can lead to writing poor-quality code.
It is essential that the developer knows what they’re doing. The tool doesn’t
replace code reviews and the need for humans in the loop.
